## 3rd Iteration


### What user stories were completed this iteration?

* A Hospital Management Menu Class was created
* Hospital Management System Class was shortened - fewer methods and methods were trimmed
* assessBMI and generatePatientID were moved to Patient class



### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

* Clone the repository into your local machine using <code> git clone url </code>

* Cd into the repository and run <code> ./runHospitalManagementSystem.sh </code>

* If you are unable to run the bash script, run <code> chmod 744 runHospitalManagementSystem.sh </code> and try again

* Once you get the program to run, you will start a new session in the Hospital Management System and the program will begin to prompt you for your input to perform tasks

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

* A basic appointment class was created but it was not implemented. In other words, it exists but doesn't do anything. We ultimately decided to keep it this way for this iteration and focus on cleaning up our Hospital Management System class.
* Our Hospital Management Menu class doesnt have unit tests because it essentially just prints and calls on other methods
